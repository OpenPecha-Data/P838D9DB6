Aspiration for the Stages of the Path
by Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa

der ni ring du bé lé tsok nyi ni
Through my enduring efforts to amass the two accumulations
kha tar yangpa gangshyik sakpa dé
Extensively, on a vast, space-like scale,
lo mik marik gi dong drowa kün
May I become a lord of the victorious ones,
namdren gyalwé wangwor dak gyur chik
A guide for all beings mentally blinded by ignorance.

der masönpé tserab küntu yang
Until then, throughout the course of my lives,
jampé yang kyi tsewé jezung té
May Mañjughoṣa guide me with his loving care,
tenpé rimpa kün tsang lam gyi chok
And may I delight the buddhas through finding and practising
nyé né drubpé gyal nam nyé jé shok
The supreme path in which every phase of teaching is complete.

rang gi jishyin tokpé lam gyi né
May I teach the key points of this path as I have realized them,
shuk drak tsewé drangpé tabkhé kyi
With skilful means and inspired by intense affection,
drowé yi kyi münpa sal jé né
And, having thereby banished the darkness that engulfs beings' minds,
gyalwé tenpa ring du dzin gyur chik
May I long uphold the teachings of the victorious buddhas!

tenpa rinchen chok gi makhyabpa am
Where the supreme, precious teachings one is yet to find,
khyab kyang nyampar gyurpé chok der ni
Or where they were once known, but have since declined,
nyingjé chenpö yi rab kyöpa yi
There, through Great Compassion, may I stir people's minds,
pendé ter dé salwar jepar shok
And cause the treasury of benefit and happiness to shine!

sé ché gyalwé mejung trinlé lé
Through the gradual stages of the path to enlightenment,
lek drub changchub lam gyi rimpé kyang
Forged through the wondrous activity of buddhas and their heirs,
tar dö nam kyi yi la pal ter shying
May I bring splendour to the minds of those seeking freedom,
gyalwé dzepa ring du kyong gyur chik
And long may I cultivate the deeds of the victorious ones!

lamzang drikpé tünkyen drubjé ching
May I create circumstances conducive to this excellent path
galkyen sel jé mi dang mi min kün
And dispel any impediments; may no-one, human or otherwise,
tserab küntu gyalwé ngakpa yi
Ever be separated from this utterly pure path,
namdak lam dang dralwar magyur chik
Which is lauded by the victorious ones.

gang tsé tekpa chok la chöchö chü
As I diligently apply myself to the genuine practice
tsulshyin drub la tsönpa dé yi tsé
Of the ten Dharma activities1 of the supreme vehicle,
tuden nam kyi taktu drok jé ching
May I always be assisted by those with mighty force,
tashi gyatsö chok künkhyab gyur chik
And may an ocean of auspiciousness pervade all directions!
This was composed by Lord Tsongkhapa Lobzang Drakpa.
